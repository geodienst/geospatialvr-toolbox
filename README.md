# Geospatial VR Toolbox #

This toolbox allows for calculating different calculations for an area with buildings. The buildings are obtained from the 3D bag of the TU Delft.
You can draw your own area for doing the measurements.

Current calculations:
* Floor Space Index
* Grond Space Index

The toolbox contains of several tools:

* objsplit.py: split up .OBJ files with multiple objects into single files (based on gist [balazsdukai/objsplit.py](https://gist.github.com/balazsdukai/dca936c72bd7a596fea5e4a2bb34a912) )
* import_and_footprint.py: Import a directory of obj files into a new file geodatabase feature class.
* calculate_fsi.py: calculate the floor space index 
* calculate_gsi.py: calculate the ground space index


### Using inside ARCGIS Pro ###

* Download the [zipfile](./download/geospatialvr-toolbox.zip) from the download directory
* Unzip the files
* Add the toolbox to a project
* Start with 01 Split obj, make use of the i icon to the left of a parameter and the ? icon on the right upper site
* After step 2 you have to draw an area of interest, which you can use in step 3a en 3b


### Using with Merkator City software ###

The scripts can also be used for exchanging data between ArcGIS (Pro) and the Merkator City software.

* documentation follows

### Requirements ###

* Arcpy environment based on ArcGIS Pro version 3.1

The tool is developed based on data from [Â© 3D BAG by tudelft3d](https://3dbag.nl/en/download)
